## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`signs.json`)

The available sign overlays are managed via the `signs.json` file located in the root of this repository. This file defines:

*   The GitHub repository details (`githubUser`, `githubRepo`, `githubBranch`, `imageBasePath`) used to construct the image URLs.
*   A list of available signs for each category (`AHC`, `GHN`), specifying the display `name` and the `fileName` located within the `images/<category>/` directory on GitHub.

```json
{
  "githubUser": "ticuv",
  "githubRepo": "SignOMatic",
  "githubBranch": "main",
  "imageBasePath": "images",
  "categories": {
    "AHC": [
      { "name": "AHC - Delist", "fileName": "delist.png" },
      { "name": "AHC - Duko", "fileName": "duko.png" }
    ],
    "GHN": [
      { "name": "GHN - Delist", "fileName": "delist.png" },
      { "name": "GHN - Duko", "fileName": "duko.png" }
    ]
  }
